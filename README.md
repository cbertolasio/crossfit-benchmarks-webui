=============
##About
This is the source code for the Crossfit Benchmarks Web UI Project.


The purpose of this app is to provide a web ui that allows Crossfit Athletes to enter
personal records and workout log entries.

## The Branches...
- Master - all code should make it into master eventually.  
- Azure-Deploy - this is the deployment branch.  When you want to get code deployed into azure, switch to the azure-deploy branch and issue a pull request from master.
- If you want to clone a copy of master into your own branch, and push that branch to the remote (eg github) and then merge it back into master at a later date - then make it happen.
