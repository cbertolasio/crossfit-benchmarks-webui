##About
This is the source code for the Crossfit Benchmarks Web UI Project.


The purpose of this app is to provide a web ui that allows Crossfit Athletes to enter
personal records and workout log entries.

## The Branches...
- Master - all code should make it into master eventually.  
- Azure-Deploy - this is the deployment branch.  When you want to get code deployed into azure, switch to the azure-deploy branch and issue a pull request from master.
- If you want to clone a copy of master into your own branch, and push that branch to the remote (eg github) and then merge it back into master at a later date - then make it happen.

# What Is Every WOD?
## Overview
Every WOD is a personal fitness tracking tool for people that practice functional fitness.  We focus on letting you track Personal Records and Previous Attempts for Benchmark Exercises, Named CrossFit WODs, and Hero WODs.  

Maybe you workout in a CrossFit Box, maybe you workout by yourself in your garage, maybe you workout with your squad in the desert.  If you have access to a mobile device, or a pc/laptop with an internet connection and a web browser - AND you are looking for a better way to tack your fitness progress - then Every WOD is for you.   

## Fitness Benchmark Tracking!
So - in our application we count Benchmarks as things like Max Effort Pull-ups, MAx Effort Push-ups, 1 Rep Max Snatch, 1 Rep Max Clean, and many many more.  For each benchmark you can track personal records and keep a historical record of previous lifts.  You can also click a single button and calculate percentages off of the previous lift and personal records.

## Named WOD Tracking!
Want to know what your personal record is for Fran?  Maybe you forgot what your previous score for Isabel was?  Whatever the case may be - Every WOD - helps you keep track of all of your Named WODs.  

## Hero WOD Tracking!
We don't do Hero WODs very often - because they tend to crush us - but when we do, we like to track how well we did.  That way - the next time we do it - we have a way to measure our progress.  By logging personal records and historical data - you have the ability to measure your own progress.

## Data Stored in the Cloud
Each user of Every WOD gets their own data storage in our cloud.  Your data is safe, and its yours.  We don't share it or sell it.  We simply store it in a safe place so that you can access it with a single - social signon - from and device or pc.

## Mobile Device Ready!
We already have our browser based version up and running.  Our plan is to create versions for Android, iOS, and Microsoft Devices.  After you install the mobile software and login with your social login, you will have access to all of your data.  Our mobile apps will store the data locally and periodically send the data back to the cloud so that you can access it from other devices and computers.

## Daily WOD Tracking
So far - we have not found much use for Daily WOD tracking - unless your Daily WOD happens to be a Named WOD or a Hero WOD.  Normally - when you practice functional fitness - things are mixed up on a daily basis - so tracking the daily stuff has not proven too helpful over time.  HOWEVER - if you want - you can still do it.

## How Much Does it Cost?
Right Now it Is FREE!  It will remain free.  In the future - we may charge ask a nominal fee for add free versions of the mobile app.  We may also ask a nominal fee for those of you that want to store more than just a few pieces of historical data.  We are working that stuff out.  That being said - we value your feedback - so if you want to kick the tires on the app and start tracking your data and providing us with some feedback - we would really appreciate your help.
